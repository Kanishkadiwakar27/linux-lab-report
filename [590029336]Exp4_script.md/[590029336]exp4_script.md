EXPERIMENT 4 – Shell Programming

n

##Aim

To understand and practice the basic concepts of Shell Scripting in Linux.



##Tools & Software Utilized

Operating System: linux mint on Oracle VirtualBox

Terminal Emulator: GNOME Terminal

Shell Environment: Bash (Bourne-Again Shell)




TASK 1: Hello World Script

Write a simple shell script that prints Hello, World! upon execution.

Script:
c:\Users\kanis\Desktop\exp4\.img\task1exp4\input task1.sh.png

output

c:\Users\kanis\Desktop\exp4\.img\task1exp4\output task1.sh.png

TASK 2: Personalized Greeting

Develop a script that asks the user to input their name and then displays a custom greeting.


script2
![alt text](< input2.png>)

output
![alt text](output2.png)



TASK 3: Arithmetic Operations

Write a program that accepts two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

TASK 4: Voting Eligibility

Design a script that prompts the user for their age and shows whether they are eligible to vote.

output

Observations

Successfully created and executed multiple Bash scripts.

The Hello, World! script validated the basic syntax of a shell program.

The greeting script illustrated how to handle user input.

The arithmetic script correctly executed mathematical operations on user inputs.

The voting eligibility script demonstrated the use of conditional statements in decision-making.




Conclusion

This experiment offered practical exposure to Bash scripting fundamentals, including input/output handling, variable usage, arithmetic operations, and conditional logic.
